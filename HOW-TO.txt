GITHUB PAGES SETUP — “Sara” (Dave Kelley)

What you have in this ZIP
-------------------------
/index.html          -> The song page with your background photo and dedication
/Sara.mp3            -> (PLACEHOLDER) Replace with your final MP3 named exactly Sara.mp3
/assets/bg.jpg       -> Background image, already optimized for web
/qr/qr.svg           -> QR code file (see notes below)

Publish on GitHub Pages (free)
------------------------------
1) Create a public repo on GitHub, e.g., sara-song
2) Upload index.html, assets/bg.jpg, and your actual Sara.mp3 (exact file name)
3) In the repository: Settings → Pages → Source = “Deploy from a branch”, Branch = main, Folder = /(root)
4) Wait ~1 minute; GitHub will give you a URL like:
     https://USERNAME.github.io/sara-song/
5) Test the page on your phone. Tap Play if autoplay is blocked (normal on iOS/Android).

QR Code
-------
• If qr.svg contains a placeholder URL, regenerate it after you know your final GitHub Pages URL.
• You can regenerate a QR instantly for free at: https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/
  - Paste your final URL (e.g., https://USERNAME.github.io/sara-song/)
  - Download as SVG for crisp printing/engraving
• Replace /qr/qr.svg with your new one.

Notes
-----
• Keep a local backup of this folder (including Sara.mp3).
• If you ever move hosts, keep the same public URL path or mint a new QR.
• For long-term stability: renew your GitHub account (don’t delete the repo).
